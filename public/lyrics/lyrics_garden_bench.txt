I've been hunting people for a living, feeding on their happiness
And I'm a burden to all things living, curse them cause I'm bored of it
This goose chase for something, I don't even know how it works
But the sight of it, the thought of disappointment has my throat clogging up
Sitting on a garden bench alone
You ask me what I'm feeling
That's what I can't put my finger on
Words can be deceiving
I've eaten up my words so many times, starting to feel like I'm always wrong
And I have broken down so many times, I used to be able to stay in control
I'm waiting for you to grow out of me, peacefully I lay in quiet
Watching all the bugs meet in a circle like an outsider
Sitting on a garden bench alone
You ask me what I'm feeling
That's what I can put my finger on
Words can be deceiving
So I shed a couple tears, remember every tear I shed
I'll write it down and blame it on someone that I misread
I'll look back and I'll sigh at these songs I used to write
How dare I dream, I'll say as I remember me
Sitting on a garden bench alone
You ask me what I'm feeling
That's what I can put my finger on
Words can be deceiving
Mystery whisper is my favorite sound
How are you gonna beat it?
I have never given in to heavy grieving
How can you believe me?
Words can be deceiving
