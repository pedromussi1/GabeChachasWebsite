I woke up at 6:50 for school
I forgot the year is over, I am such a fool
I can't believe I got nobody to talk to
Conversations with myself, I am listening
It's heavy here, my body's decomposing
In this dirty couch with chips I finished watching TV
I'm sicken up and planted in my hoodie
New movie's out, no one to see it with
I'd go back in time, make it winter
New-born spite, feel it never
Back in time when we were together
Monotone summer
Moods will change like the weather
The sun is bright but my heart is bitter
Back in time when we were together
Monotone summer
Monotone summer
I jump in the pool, let the water fill my lungs
July afternoon, got my tear ducts feeling numb
Laying on the grass, feel the sun against my face
ripping off what's left of all the memories that we made
I'd go back in time, make it winter
New-born spite, feel it never
Back in time when we were together
Monotone summer
Moods will change like the weather
The sun is bright but my heart is bitter
Back in time when we were together
Monotone summer
Monotone summer
Monotone summer
Monotone summer
Monotone summer
