Running to the other mountain
Can I pick and choose my fight?
When I don't know where to go
Can I close my eyes and think of somewhere nice
Forgiving the never unforgiven
Is like ruining something that's non-existent
When I hand you my heart, will you patch it up nice, or stab it
With a dull kitchen knife, or Will you move on with your life?
I'll leave you to it
You'll lead me astray
The stars continue to shine and I'll continue to cry
Cause you don't love me that way
You don't love me that way
You don't love me that way
My love is dying Mom, will you let me go?
Can't feel my hands, will you just pick up the phone?
I don't wanna answer it I don't wanna talk about that
Say I'm not there I went out to run some errands
You don't want me, you don't want me, you don't want me, you don't want me
You don't love me, you don't love me You don't love me, you don't love me
You don't love me that way
