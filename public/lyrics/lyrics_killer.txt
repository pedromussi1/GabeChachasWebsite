They'll call me a killer, they'll catch me in the scene
They'll see the blood dripping from my parents' balcony
And when I pull the trigger, I bet everyone would hear
My parents would be terrorized, I know mom would shed a tear
They'll call my name in fear as they look in every room
They trace the scent of blood from my body lying under the moon
I'm guilty, I'm the killer, I'm guilty, I'm the killer
No, it won't be fun seeing my face in every mirror
They'll take down all the drawings from the walls I've built around me
Maybe then they notice all the drawn faces are frowning
I know it will be hard to invite my friends to the funeral
They wouldn't say a thing cause they know nothing about me
I'm guilty, I'm the killer, I'm guilty, I'm the killer
No, it won't be fun seeing my face in every mirror
I'm guilty, I'm the killer, I'm guilty, I'm the killer
No, it won't be fun seeing my face in every mirror
And if I pray enough, will it save me
Will it kill these demons who want to erase me
And when I look back, will it kill me
To remind myself that it never changed me
I'm guilty, I'm the killer, I'm guilty, I'm the killer
No, it won't be fun seeing my face in every mirror
I'm guilty, I'm the killer, I'm guilty, I'm the killer
No, it won't be fun seeing my face in every mirror
And if I pray enough, will it save me
Will it kill these demons who want to erase me
And when I look back, will it kill me
To remind myself that it never changed me
It's nice out, so let's watch the birds at the garden
