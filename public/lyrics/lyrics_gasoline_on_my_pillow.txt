I'm not healed
My wounds are still bleeding
The band-aid that you stuck on my knees are unsticking
Blood dripping, your lies hurt more than truths 'cause I know that
You don't mean it, you don't mean it, no
I'm not fine
My limbs have grown numb
Every bridge I've ever built is coming undone
All I've done to prove I'm worthy of your love, worthy of your affection
Can't recognize my own reflection
You're the one who made me undergo this change
Folded me like origami, sharpened up, cut through your chain
Cursed my name, never saw it coming
'Cause my baby, I was convinced that maybe we had something
I'm on my knees
Begging for you to see
That everything I've ever done was for you to like me
Your remedy is my cecity
Remind me once again why you enjoy to watch me plead
You're the one who made me undergo this change
Folded me like origami, sharpened up, cut through your chain
Cursed my name, never saw it coming
'Cause my baby, I was convinced that maybe we had something
Pour the gasoline on my pillow
Let you sabotage me, do whatever you want
'Cause I need you, and baby, I can't breathe without you
Your vicious teeth is all I need tonight
I can trust you, do whatever you may like
'Cause you know I love a sucker with a twisted knife
You're the one who made me undergo this change
Folded me like origami, sharpened up, cut through your chain
Cursed my name, never saw it coming
'Cause my baby, I was convinced that maybe we had something
Pour the gasoline on my pillow
Let you sabotage me, do whatever you want
'Cause I need you, and baby, I can't breathe without you
Your vicious teeth is all I need tonight
I can trust you, do whatever you may like
'Cause you know I love a sucker with a twisted knife
