For every word I said
You aimed at my chest, nodded, and at my heart you shot
Now you say, "are you sad?" Ha!
Go ahead, guilt trip me into saying that I'm not
I smile, dress up my anguish and I nod
Afraid of what my honesty would cost
I don't know what I want
Tell me what I've done
Don't distance yourself
Don't dare show emotion
Just look around and stand still and grin
Like a tin man
(Like a tin man, wooh-oh)
(Like a tin man!)
I stand in disbelief as I watch you disable all my sensibility
And make it seem like you're fixing the broken pieces inside me
So come again, ask again, my answer won't change
Play pretend, I'll pretend, "I'm doing great!"
I don't know what I want
Tell me what I've done
Don't distance yourself
Don't dare show emotion
Just look around and stand still and grin
Like a tin man
(Like a tin man, wooh-oh)
(Like a tin man!)
But where's my heart? I've been looking for it since forever
But where's my heart?
I don't know what I want
Tell me what I've done
Don't distance yourself
Don't dare show emotion
Just look around and stand still and grin, oh
Stand still an grin, stand still and grin
Like a tin man
(Like a tin man, wooh-oh)
(Like a tin man!)
But where's my heart? I've been looking for it since forever
(But where's my heart?)
