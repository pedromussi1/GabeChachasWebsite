Getting rid of this drama
Hearing things that I don't wanna
My inner voice saying things I don't wanna know
Gossiping, gotta let that go
For starters, I'm the ruler here
My inner voice telling me I gotta disappear
How do I take control
Get a hold might take some time but
I'm gonna drive my mind
I'm gonna drive my mind
I'm gonna drive
Wiping out these thoughts
Cause they shouldn't be brought
I think my melting brain has had enough
Forget
All the things I said about you
That wasn't me, I swear
I wasn't consciously
Thought that I was living in a dream
Single out my head like a bully
I won't give in to puppy eyes
I need my license, I need to drive
(drive, drive, drive)
I'm gonna drive my mind
I'm gonna drive my mind
I'm gonna drive
Wiping out these thoughts
Cause they shouldn't be brought
I think my melting brain has had enough
Everybody says I gotta clean myself
To stop taking orders from myself
Everybody says I gotta clean myself
To stop taking orders from myself
But I've been talking to me
And he said not to do that to me
And I've been thinking about it
And I think I might give it up
I'm gonna drive my mind
I'm gonna drive my mind
I'm gonna drive my mind
I'm gonna drive my mind
I'm gonna drive my mind
