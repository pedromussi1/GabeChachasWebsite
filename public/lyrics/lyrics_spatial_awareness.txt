My friends have been making jokes about the both of us
A few nights ago, I was planning to let you know that they're right about me
But are they right about you?
Spatial, spatial, spatial awareness My heart is ripping right out of my body
And I can't, I can't even fight it, It's a fly in the ointment
I've been seeking your love like a brand new disease
Sick of dreaming of being stuck under your sheets
Spatial, spatial, spatial awareness
My heart is ripping right out of my body
And I can't, I can't even fight it
It's a fly in the ointment
Lovesick hearts "boom" but don't come with a warning
Look out, look out, I might be exploding
The one I like will always find a good placе to hide
"Ready or not, herе I come," it's my only line
You rub off so easily
I can hardly breathe
When you're looking at me
You keep your distance away from me
Do you know
Do you see right through me
You rub off so easily
I can hardly breathe
When you're looking at me
Spatial, spatial, spatial awareness
My heart is ripping right out of my body
And I can't, I can't even fight it
It's a fly in the ointment
Lovesick hearts "boom" but don't come with a warning
Look out, look out, I might be exploding
The one I like will always find a good place to hide
"Ready or not, here I come," it's my only line
